# regex list of absolute mountpoint paths and policy, separated by a space
# paths that match that aren't mountpoints are ignored
# all mountpoints found below a given match are assumed to use the same policy
# if policy-by-volume gives a different policy, policy-order is consulted
# first path that matches is used
# if no policy is found, policy-default is consulted
